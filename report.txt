What I liked about my design is that by implementing and extending classes, I was able to facilitate the behavior of the ships specifically 
the observer and observable behaviors. Additionally, by creating instances of the pirate class, I was able to easily add many pirates.
The way the classes interacted made it easy to keep track of what grids were taken and which were not. If I were to extend the design,
for example the game reset, I would have a button and an event handler to reset everything by making every grid empty again and finding
positions for everything again. This would have to be handled by the oceanmap class. To add pictures to the islands I would simply add an
image view for the islands instead of just making them green.
