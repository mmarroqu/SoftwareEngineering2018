My Program is divided into 3 files the Main class where one can create a race add horses to it
and run the race. It has a Race class that keeps track of every horse in the race as well as 
how many horse are in the race. The race class has a method to add horses to the race with such
things as horse name their max speed and their strategy as the arguments. Finally the Race class
has a start race function that creates a thread for every horse so they can "race" in parrallel.
Since the race class has horses I created a horse class. When a horse is created it display info
on it for debugging purposes. The horse class has a method to change the strategy of the current
horse. In order to run the horses in parrallel with the threads this class has a run method.
The run method increments a counter depending on the strategy picked. The ammount that the counter
will go up depends on if it has passed predetermined thresholds. Periodically we interrupt so
the program prints out where each horse is in the race. Once the counter reaches the final threshold
it prints out that the horse has finished. The reason for dividing the race and horse class is 
in order to follow object oriented programming practices. The race HAS A horse (or multiple for that
matter) and we need to instantiate multiple instances of horses with different names and strategies.
As such two classes were created to facilitate this. In addition to this the Horse class implements
Runnable. This was done in order to be able to run some of its methods in parrallel with other 
Horse instances through threads.
